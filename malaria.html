Interview with Ben Amodu on Malaria Cure
</p>

<p>Tell us about your 1-hour malaria cure.
WHO sponsored me to the US to present the discovery that cures malaria in one hour and this has been gazette by the Indian Journal of Medical Research which is 141 years old. The Indian Journal has published my discovery. Also, we were together with about seven professors from South Africa who are coming to do a clinical survey on my drugs soon. Unknown to me, the professors investigated me; they wanted to find out if I copied somebody’s work. Out of 153 countries of the Commonwealth, they started moving from one country to the other to see maybe they will find someone’s work that I might have copied, not until they went to the 90thcountry and the result they found was nothing like that before they sent me an email to say we want to confirm to you, these researches are original to you and we want to let you know we are with you till the end, and even that has brought the man, an American that discovered Fansidar to this house. In 2012, I was invited to Burj Al-Arab in Dubai and awarded the pharmaceutical researcher of the year 2012 for my singular discovery for the cure of hepatitis B and C and in that paper the mentioned my herbal anti-retroviral drug. If the European countries can lead us in some areas while we have also discovered some areas why can’t we lead and others follow? As far as I am concerned, today in the area of communicable and non-communicable diseases including tuberculosis which Nigeria is 2nd in Africa and about number seven in the world, I have the solution to common and resistant tuberculosis. I am currently treating a lady with HIV AIDS, she is in the Netherlands. Her viral load was 22,700 but within three weeks her viral load reduced to 6,700; she sent me the results. Somebody with hepatitis C came to me with a viral load of 422,000 after treatment in a few weeks, it couldn’t be detected. In one of our big hospitals here somebody had 170 million Hepatitis B virus, we treated and it came down to 23 million, after she got cured she didn’t come back to give us the final result. We didn’t do the tests in my lab, the test were done in highbrow hospitals in Abuja here, so why are we pretending?
<p>Despite the approval from W.H.O that people should use herbal medicine, people and government still have a phobia for that.
What is your message to government and Nigerians?
You are talking about diversification. WHO has proposed 5trillion dollars business from the herbal sector in the next five years, which nobody is yet to talk about whereas Nigeria has a quality that can tap into that 5trillion dollars project and then get so much money and occupy its position in the comity of nations in terms of respect. What I am doing, nobody else is doing it anywhere in the world. If they do let them come out let us see for ourselves. For Kidney stones, I can give you our combo mixtures without any issues.</p>
<p>Beyond research, what are you doing to make average Nigerians know and benefit from your researches?
We have to encourage ourselves by avoiding medical tourism outside the country, this is why I am trying to set up a hospital based on the use of this local herbal medicines that has gone through all the certified processes so that a number of un-resolved medical issues can be resolved through this method and I am happy people report to me vividly about the result of the use of my medicine, Our hospital is going to be called African Alternative Medicines Hospital, Abuja. It is going to take care of a number of unresolved medical issues, like someone who has kidney stones and is afraid of surgery; prostate cancer and maybe afraid of surgery, appendicitis and afraid of surgery, anemia, and even fibroid.</p>
<p>These are specialised areas our drugs go there carry out operative procedures and the patient becomes okay without any form of operation procedures so that when such place is established and people are coming and getting results, from there they would be encouraged and then we can grow our Nigerian herbal medicines.</p>
<p>One problem we’ve always had especially from this part of the world is that such work into research dies with the researcher. What are you doing to ensure that your work outlives you?
I have a number of people working with me to be able to carry on with this project so that it is not just dependent on the knowledge I have since it is not something that was handed over to me by my parents; it is something we went through procedure of research to get and they are being documented. I have people working with me so that it will outlive me.Specifically, <p>what are those diseases you can conveniently handle?
Like I said earlier, that our specific area of research are communicable which comprises of HIV AIDS, hepatitis, and tuberculosis; and under the non- communicable diseases I mentioned those gamut of diseases almost ten of them and this things branch out as matter of fact, like I gave you an example, something for cancer of the colon turns out to cure cancer of the lungs and asthma. One thing does many things because in herbal medicine it works on the principle of combinations, and you can see the anti-oxide effect of bitter leaf, for instance which can do many things. I have said this a very long time ago, but until a white man said so, people did not take my research seriously. I have been working with bitter leaf in the last 20 years. Just recently I saw a documentary posted to me that in the U.S they have been able to manufacture capsules of bitter leaf which I have been doing in the last 20 years and I have appeared in the Guardian Newspaper amongst several others, that it can do so many things yet the doubting Thomases sat on the fence, yet now that they have heard it is done in the U.S, they are beginning to believe it. I have done that before them, and I continue to do and I am not discouraged because I believe in what I am doing.
